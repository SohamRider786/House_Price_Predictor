## Overview 📋

This project uses a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict house prices based on a dataset containing property features. The process includes:
- Data preprocessing (handling categorical variables, encoding, and feature scaling).
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- Training the model and evaluating its performance using the R² score.
- Visualizing the actual vs. predicted prices with scatter plots.

## Features ✨
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values and categorical variables with one-hot and label encoding.
  - Scaled numerical features to improve model performance.
  
- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Used Random Forest Regressor for high accuracy in predictions.
  - Evaluated the model using metrics like R² score.

- **Visualization:**
  - Plotted actual vs. predicted house prices for performance analysis.

## Dataset 📊
- **Source:** The dataset was sourced from `Housing.csv`.
- **Attributes:**
  - Features include size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
  - Target variable: **House Price**.

*Note: Include a link to the dataset if publicly available.*
